# Generic ATLAS Calorimeter

This is the composite calorimeter approximation of the ATLAS detector.

## Detector construction:

It's a composite cilindric calorimeter with eletromagnetic and hadronic layers with 6.12m in z starting 90cm of disntance
in the collision line and 148cm of material.

Description:

- First EM layer (stripts) with 15 cm depth (xy) and 2 segments (layers) of LAr and Pb (0.003 x 0.003); 
- Second EM layer with 30 cm depth (xy) and 2 segments (layers) of LAr and Pb (0.025 x 0.025); 
- Third EM layer with 3 cm depth (xy) and 2 segments (layers) of LAr and Pb (0.05 x 0.025); 
- First HAD layer with 40 cm depth (xy) and 2 segments (layers) of Cesium iodide and iron (0.1 x 0.1); 
- Second HAD layer with 40 cm depth (xy) and 2 segments (layers) of Cesium iodide and iron (0.1 x 0.1); 
- Third HAD layer with 20 cm depth (xy) and 1 segments (layers) of Cesium iodide and iron (0.2 x 0.1);
